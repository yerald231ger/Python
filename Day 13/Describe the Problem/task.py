# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# Is iterating through the range of number from 1 to 20 and if the number is equal to 20 it will print out "You got it"
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# "you hot it" when the number is equal to 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# it does not reach 20 at any point
